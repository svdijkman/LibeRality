# LibeRality 0.3.0

- Makes the externally cross-validated FO block-diagonal information
  approximation the default for new designs. `full_gaussian` remains an
  explicit supported alternative.
- Advances the serializable design schema to version 2 and deterministically
  migrates legacy saved designs to `fo_block`, preventing a silent change of
  their historical interpretation.
- Retains criterion-specific allocation derivatives, fixed-shape Weibull TTE
  information, matched simulation/FIM exposure conventions, and genuine
  estimator-interval coverage diagnostics.
- Records the active approximation in information, evaluation, history, and
  external-validation provenance.

# LibeRality 0.2.12

- Adds fixed-shape Weibull time-to-event working information and simulation
  using matched cumulative-hazard interval increments. The endpoint contract
  explicitly uses `H(t) = lambda * t^shape` and requires the shape value.
- Adds a regulatory-informed first-in-human single-ascending-dose wizard
  template with five editable active-dose cohorts, rich PK sampling, explicit
  escalation order, and retained sentinel/placebo/review-gate planning
  metadata. Compound-specific starting-dose justification, safety limits,
  placebo implementation, stopping rules, and escalation governance remain
  deliberately outside the automatic template.
- Uses criterion-specific allocation sensitivities for D, Ds, A, E, c,
  prediction-variance, and L optimality instead of routing non-D criteria
  through a D-optimal allocation update. Unsupported or non-smooth cases fail
  explicitly.
- Replaces ordinal and supported residual-model finite differences with
  analytic derivatives, adds a default analytic one-compartment FIM regression,
  and reports empirical estimator-interval coverage only when covariance
  estimates are actually available.

# LibeRality 0.2.11

- Adds simulated endpoint profiles and tabular summaries to the Simulation tab,
  including native LibeRation NCA exposure summaries where scientifically
  applicable.
- Marks Robustness complete after all configured scenario information has been
  evaluated and makes feasibility results clickable with plain-language rule,
  observed-value, limit, and violation details.

# LibeRality 0.2.10

- Consolidates the workflow progress row and content tabs into one navigation
  row. Model, trial-design, objective, evaluation, optimisation, and simulation
  tabs now carry their numbered or completed stage indicator directly.
- Uses `#B87333` for the dark-theme active-tab underline and completed workflow
  circles; completed stages retain white checkmarks for clear status contrast.

# LibeRality 0.2.9

- Uses the same warm mineral-slate header in light and dark themes, with
  explicit high-contrast header text. Primary study-design controls now use
  the selected-arm copper as their button surface and the sidebar surface as
  their text colour.
- Extends the design wizard with regulatory-informed starting layouts for
  standard 2×2 bioequivalence, full-replicate RSABE, food-effect, fixed-sequence
  DDI, TQT, concentration-QTc, renal-impairment, and hepatic-impairment studies.
  Each template states its framework and compound/protocol-specific limitations
  and remains an editable design—not a claim of regulatory adequacy.
- Adds persistent, immutable design histories under the shared LibeR
  workspace. The GUI groups current and previous designs with sequential
  versions, exposes unsaved-change state, and requires the user to save or
  explicitly discard edits before switching.
- Keeps portable RDS import/export separate from the workspace-backed design
  history, and exports `lity_design_history()`, `lity_design_version_save()`,
  and `lity_design_version_load()` for scripted reproducibility.

# LibeRality 0.2.8

- Aligns the application header with the selected-arm accent surface and uses
  the warmer copper active-tab colour for primary study-design actions.
- Labels direct `$PRED` models by their actual execution route rather than
  exposing the inert ADVAN1/TRANS1 compatibility fields retained by the shared
  model schema.
- Adds classical ED-optimality, maximizing the expected determinant over
  weighted parameter scenarios using a stable `log E[det(F)]` calculation,
  with full criterion guidance in the GUI.
- Adds a guided trial-design wizard with editable templates for rich
  single-dose PK, staggered sparse population PK, repeated-dose steady state,
  parallel dose-ranging, infusion, paediatric sparse, and exposure-response
  studies. Templates produce the ordinary serializable `lity_design` object.
- Adds an editable model workspace for `$PK`, direct/post-ADVAN `$PRED`, `$DES`,
  `$ERROR`, THETA values and bounds, OMEGA, and SIGMA. Rebuilding and
  validation are delegated to LibeRation's shared `nm_model_update()` API.
- Replaces free-text endpoint link and distribution fields with
  outcome-specific selections and validates the same choices in the R API.

# LibeRality 0.2.7

- Redesigns the workbench around a visible Model → Trial design → Objectives →
  Evaluate → Optimise → Simulate workflow, with contextual actions and
  automatic navigation to newly completed results.
- Adds complete GUI editors for design identity, arms, endpoints, uncertainty
  scenarios, optimisable variables, and typed constraints, including
  confirmation for destructive changes and stale-result invalidation.
- Groups all 29 supported design criteria by purpose, shows a one-line
  explanation in the selector, and adds a `?` dialog covering the statistical
  construction, prerequisites, strengths, limitations, and use cases of every
  criterion.
- Replaces the amber workbench with the Mineral Slate and Copper palette,
  including accessible light/dark surfaces, a restrained copper action colour,
  slate headers, and responsive workflow controls.
- Adds explicit simulation seeds, clearer optimiser names and run summaries,
  deployment-aware file-path warnings, and richer design/reproducibility
  inspection.

# LibeRality 0.2.6

- Adds a unified model browser for built-in LibeRation templates, existing
  LibeRation project versions and completed estimation runs, reviewed
  LibeRary entries, and local NONMEM control streams.
- Adds a dedicated Model tab with compartment structure, outcomes, nominal
  parameters, parameter-source semantics, and immutable import provenance.
- Lazily resolves full workspace and catalogue models only when previewed;
  model changes remap compatible schedules, request missing design covariates,
  clear dimension-dependent results, and retain an auditable revision history.
- Adds `lity_model_from_liberation()` and fixes review-status handling in the
  LibeRary importer.
- Uses a lighter amber application header in the light theme with
  high-contrast branding. The dark theme uses a warmer amber header and
  reserves the lighter primary-action amber for the active theme-switch rail.
- Advances the browser asset identifier so an upgraded installation cannot
  reuse the former header stylesheet from cache.

# LibeRality 0.2.5

- Applies the ecosystem-wide non-fading busy-state behavior while retaining
  the existing asynchronous design-analysis task channel.
- Increments the workbench asset version to invalidate cached GUI resources
  after upgrading.

# LibeRality 0.2.4

- Removes generated native build products from the standalone source mirror
  and adds cross-platform publication safeguards after Linux deployment
  exposed an incompatible Windows object file.

# LibeRality 0.2.3

- Publishes LibeRality in the LibeR 0.9 research-beta compatibility set with
  PopED/PFIM-matched capabilities separated from internally verified advanced
  design criteria.

# LibeRality 0.2.2

- Restores the established high-resolution LibeR dove and aligns the workbench
  header, typography, controls, panels, and spacing with the shared shell.
- Adds the shared LibeR theme preference, accessible focus-managed dialogs,
  consistent keyboard focus, and a transparent amber dove asset.

# LibeRality 0.2.1

- Expands analytic information-matrix and design-criterion regression coverage
  and runs all maintained PopED/PFIM external-validation fixtures repeatedly.
- Adds a runnable example and browser-level workbench startup coverage.

# LibeRality 0.2.0

- Adds a public typed-contract restore boundary for safe LibeRties result
  decoding, including Pareto optimisation results.
- Aligns package compatibility, continuous integration, validation gates,
  citation, and release provenance with the consolidated ecosystem release.

# LibeRality 0.1.3

- Allows the GUI to return its Shiny application object for hosted deployment.

# LibeRality 0.1.2

- Replaces the RcppEigen dependency with the direct Eigen 5.0.1 interface
  exported by LibeRtAD. Expected-information assembly now shares the same
  pinned C++ linear-algebra implementation as LibeRation.
- Replaces the provisional workbench mark with the high-resolution,
  transparent LibeR dove, recoloured in LibeRality's warm amber design palette
  and shared by the browser favicon and application header.
- Extends the ecosystem favicon build pipeline with a reproducible LibeRality
  amber variant.

# LibeRality 0.1.1

- Adds executable, versioned external validation against PopED 0.7.0 and PFIM
  7.0.3 using complete Fisher matrices, RSEs, determinants, matched D-optimal
  searches, and cold/warm runtime benchmarks.
- Adds the explicit `fo_block` information convention used for interoperable
  PopED/PFIM comparisons while retaining the fuller Gaussian convention as the
  default.
- Adds permanent fixtures, dependency/runner scripts, machine-readable result
  artifacts, tests, an HTML report, and a reproducibility vignette.

# LibeRality 0.1.0

- Introduces the complete serialisable optimal-design object model.
- Adds population expected-information calculations backed by exact
  LibeRation prediction derivatives and an Eigen C++ assembler.
- Implements local, robust, Bayesian, discrimination, power, clinical-decision,
  cost, burden, compound, constrained, and Pareto criteria.
- Adds continuous, discrete, integer, allocation, and hybrid optimisation.
- Adds complete-trial simulation, operating characteristics, reports,
  LibeRary/LibeRation/LibeRator adapters, and LibeRties queue execution.
- Adds the React optimal-design workbench with persistent light/dark theme.
